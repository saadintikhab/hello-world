# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I am Saad Intikhab. I work in the Snyder group. My research involves understanding the reaction mechanism for hydrogen evolution (HER) and hydrogen oxidation (HOR) reactions at high pH. The goal is to use this understanding for the rational design of active and stable electrocatalysts for alkaline based fuel cells and electrolyzers.
